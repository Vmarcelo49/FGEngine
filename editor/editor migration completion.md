# Editor Migration Completion

serialization is all here :)
old animation.go now is editorManager, still missing some functionality
we will skip old input.go for now
character got a good progress and we are now with the first widget

little marcelo, do the ui next!

## What is being done here

i am migrating the code from [Animation Editor](https://github.com/Vmarcelo49/animEditor) to here
