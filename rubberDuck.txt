Which other packages we still need?
proably:

stages
gameLogic?
netplay

why would a stages package be useless?
a stage is an animation that takes the whole screen, so it would only have info to load an animation, initialize/clean the anim, play a music file
could fit inside the animation package, just a file called stages.go probably would work

why would gameLogic be bad?
hmmm, i dont have a good grasp on how the game logic will work from now, this package proably will be needed

netplay code sucks
rollback seems hard af
