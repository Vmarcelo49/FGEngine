What is needed to be done next:
(in order of importance)

- Finish the editor port, it currently only renders the character on 0,0 and the box rendering seems wrong.

- The actual game duh...


Things for the future:

- Scene Manager
- netplay package
- Proper configuration of the window and audio related stuff
