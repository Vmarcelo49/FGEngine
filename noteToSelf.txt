my guidelines for this project are:

everything must be easy to understand and maintain, even if it takes a long time to make, the most crucial thing is readability
then the next most important thing is performance, if it is fast, its good

the code style to follow:

most important code of the package on the top

types then its constructor then all their methods below it

type XXX struct{

}

func NewXXX()

func (x *XXX)DoSegs(){

}
